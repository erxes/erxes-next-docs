# Workflow

### Branches
All changes should be part of a branch and submitted as a pull request - your branches should be prefixed with one of:

- fix/ for bug fixes
- feat/ for features
- docs/ for documentation changes

### Commits

Strive towards keeping your commits small and isolated - this helps the reviewer understand what is going on and makes it easier to process your requests.

### Pull Requests

Once your changes are ready, you must submit your branch as a pull request. Your pull request should be opened against the development branch in the main erxes repo.

In your PR's description, you should follow the structure:

- What - what changes are in this PR
- Why - why are these changes relevant
- How - how have the changes been implemented
- Testing - how have the changes been tested or how can the reviewer test the feature

We highly encourage that you do a self-review prior to requesting a review. To do a self-review click the review button in the top right corner, go through your code and annotate your changes. This makes it easier for the reviewer to process your PR.

### Merge Style

All pull requests are squashed and merged.


# Release

The erxes team will regularly create releases from the main branch.
