# Contributing to Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the erxes documentation! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to our documentation effectively.

## Overview

The documentation website is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a framework that optimizes documentation creation. If you're not familiar with Docusaurus, it's recommended to check out the [Installation documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) on their website to understand Docusaurus better, how it works, its structure, and more details. The documentation codebase is hosted as part of the [erxes repository](https://github.com/erxes/erxes) on GitHub. You'll find the code that runs the docusaurus website under the www/docs directory.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Install dependencies
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a pull request

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into sections and subsections. Each section is defined in the sidebar configuration. For more information about the sidebar structure, check out the [Docusaurus sidebar documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/items).

## Writing Guidelines

1. Use clear and concise language
2. Include code examples where appropriate
3. Add screenshots for UI-related documentation
4. Keep documentation up to date with code changes
